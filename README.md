In this 2D platformer, players find themselves in a world infused with elemental magic. As the protagonist, you possess a unique ability to harness and control the forces of air, fire, ice and earth. Each element grants you specific powers, enabling you to manipulate your environment and overcome formidable obstacles.

Collect the wind power-up to obtain an air ball which can be used to hover over clouds, temporarily giving you the ability to glide and levitate and move faster above ground. With fire, you can shoot obstacles using the fireball ability, giving you an offensive attack and allowing you to switch on/off moving platforms. Ice allows you to freeze enemies temporarily. Certain frozen enemies can be used as platforms to progress through the level. Acid raindrops can be frozen into ice cubes, which can be used as placeholders on buttons to open/close doors. Earth grants you a shield that acts both as a defense and offense. Activated earth shield prevents any damage from obstacles and enemies, and it can also be used in combat to inflict damage to the enemies on collision. 

What sets this game apart are the interactions that the player has to make with the in-game elements in order to harness its various abilities. For example, the player can use the ability to fly only by maneuvering its way through the white clouds. Fire allows you to interact with moving platforms, ice with monsters and door switches and earth with breakable walls. As you progress, your mastery over these elements deepens, granting you the ability to use the powers in combination with each other for more intricate solutions to the challenges posed in the game.

The final level of the game is the Boss level, where the player solves puzzles to meet the boss who can also use the same powers as the player can but at an enhanced rate of damage and frequency. Defeat the boss with a combination of elements to reach the trophy and win the game.
